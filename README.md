# React Tailwindcss Boilerplate build with Vite

This is a [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) boilerplate to be used with [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com).


## Description

I built this file upload portal for a client. It leverages React and Tailwindcss to build a drag 'n' drop file upload system that interfaces
with Amazon S3 and an external backend API. The upload functionality has been disabled in this repo.

## What is inside?

- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org)
